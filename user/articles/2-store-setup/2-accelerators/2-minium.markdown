# Minium [](id=minium)

The Minium Accelerator models a business-to-business site geared to meet the
needs of a wholesale distributor. Minium showcases the B2B account management
system where multiple users with various Roles can be added to a single
account.

## Theme

The Minium theme includes a number of embedded features, including pop-up
navigation and cart menus, and an Account & Order selector.

The Account & Order selector displays accounts that the current user can access
(administrators can access any account). Once an account is selected, its open
orders are displayed.

## Pages

Minium populates a site with several widgets and pages, providing a complete
user experience for buyers. To see the full list of pages, go to *Site Menu*
&rarr; *Build* &rarr; *Pages*.

In general, these pages work as described
[here](/web/commerce/documentation/-/knowledge_base/1-0/store-layout-and-design),
but there are some differences. For example, instead of using a dedicated
categories page, the site's homepage displays the entire contents of the
catalog. To display products of a single category, select a checkbox in the
Category Facet widget.

Minium does not use a conventional cart page. Instead, a link to the checkout
page is included in the theme-embedded cart menu.

## Catalog

Minium's catalog includes a range of sample products divided into several
categories; these have been assigned various specifications and prices. Of
course, these are no use in setting up a live store, but can save you a lot of
time while you're working to understand the catalog's functionality.

## Settings

Minium activates a number of site settings that are not enabled in a blank
site. The site's country and currency lists are filled in, and some default
measurement units are provide along with three fictional warehouses.

Minium sets the Site Type to B2B, which assumes that all your buyers'
accounts are business accounts, rather than personal. See [Site
Types](/web/commerce/documentation/-/knowledge_base/1-0/accounts#site-types) for more
information.
