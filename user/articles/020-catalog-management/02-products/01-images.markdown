# Images [](id=images)

A product image or video is a media file that has a relationship to a particular
product. This relationship can be used to ensure that the appropriate images are
displayed on product detail pages, in search results, or anywhere else
information about the product is displayed. Images can also be associated with
a specific product variant.

Follow these steps to create a product image:

1.  Go to the product's page (*Commerce* &rarr; *Catalog* &rarr; select
    product), click on the *Images* tab and then the *Add* button in the
    upper-right to display the *Add Image* form. Click *Select File* to upload
    a new image or video, or to select one from the documents and media
    repository. Set a priority to control the order to publish attachments on
    a page (lower numbers come first).

2.  If you want to associate the image with a specific product variant, select
    one from the *Options* section of the *Add Image* form. (Variants are only
    available if a product has options designated as SKU contributors. See
    [Options](/web/commerce/documentation/-/knowledge_base/1-0/options) for
    details).

3.  If you want the image to be displayed on the product page for a limited
    period of time, specify display and expiration dates in the *Schedule*
    section at the bottom of the form. Click *Publish.*

## Default Product Images [](id=default-product-images)

If a default image has been set, the *Product Details* widget displays it for
products published without images of their own.

To set a default image:

1.  Go to *Site Menu* &rarr; *Commerce* &rarr; *Settings* and click the
    *Default Images* tab.

2.  Drag & Drop to upload an image, or click *Select File* to choose one from
    the documents and media repository.

3.  Click *Save*.

The image you selected is now displayed for all products with no other image
assigned to them.
